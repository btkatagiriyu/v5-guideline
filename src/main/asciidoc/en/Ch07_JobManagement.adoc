[[Ch07_JobManagement]]
= Job Management

[[Ch07_JobManagement_Overview]]
== Overview
Explain how to manage job execution.

This function is the same usage for chunk model and tasklet model.

=== What is Job Execution Management?
It means to record the activation state and execution result of the job and maintain the batch system.
In particular, it is important to secure necessary information in order to detect when an abnormality has occurred and determine what action should be taken next (such as rerun / restart after abnormal termination).
Due to the characteristics of the batch application, it is rare that the result can be confirmed on the user interface immediately after startup.
Therefore, it is necessary to have a mechanism to record execution status and results separately from job execution, such as job scheduler / RDBMS / application log.

==== Functions Offered by {SB}

{SB} provides the following interface for job execution management.

[cols="40,60", options="header"]
.List of job management functions
|===
|Function
|Corresponding interface

|Record job execution status/result
|``org.springframework.batch.core.repository.JobRepository``

|Convert job exit code and process exit code
|``org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.ExitCodeMapper``

|===

{SB} uses ``JobRepository`` for recording the job's activation status and execution result.
For {batch5_shortname}, if all of the following are true, persistence is optional:

* Using {batch5_shortname} only for synchronous job execution.
* Managing all job execution with the job scheduler including job stop/restart.
** Especially not using restart assuming ``JobRepository`` of {SB}.

When these are applicable, use ``H2`` which is an in-memory/built-in database as an option of RDBMS used by ``JobRepository``. +
On the other hand, when using asynchronous execution or when using stop/restart of {SB}, an RDBMS that can persist the job execution status/result is required.

[IMPORTANT]
.Default transaction isolation level
====
In xsd provided by {SB}, the transaction isolation level of ``JobRepository`` has ``SERIALIZABLE`` as the default value.
However, in this case, when multiple jobs are executed concurrently regardless of whether it is synchronous or asynchronous, an exception occurs in updating ``JobRepository``.
Therefore, {batch5_shortname} sets the transaction isolation level of ``JobRepository`` to ``READ_COMMITTED`` in advance.
====

[NOTE]
.In-memory JobRepository Options
====
{SB} has ``org.springframework.batch.core.repository.support.MapJobRepositoryFactoryBean``
which performs job execution management in-memory,
but it is not used in this guideline. +
As shown in the Javadoc of this class,
It is explained that it is for testing as
``This repository is only really intended for use in testing and rapid prototyping.``
and  that it is inappropriate for parallel processing as
``Not suited for use in multi-threaded jobs with splits``
====

For the job execution management using job scheduler, refer to the manual of each product. +
In this guideline,
explain the following items related to managing the job status using ``JobRepository`` within {batch5_shortname}.

.Items related to state management within TERASOLUNA Batch

** How to persist state
** How to check the status
** How to stop the job manually
* <<Ch07_JobManagement_ExitCode>>
* <<Ch07_JobManagement_DuplicateSafe>>
* <<Ch07_JobManagement_Logging>>
* <<Ch07_JobManagement_MessageManagement>>

[[Ch07_JobManagement_HowToUse]]
== How to use

``JobRepository`` provided by {SB} registers/updates the job status/execution result in RDBMS automatically. +
When confirming them, select one of the following methods so that unintended change processing is not performed from inside or outside the batch application.

* Query the table relating to <<Ch07_JobManagement_JobStatusManagement,Job Status Management>>
* Use ``org.springframework.batch.core.explore.JobExplorer``

[[Ch07_JobManagement_JobStatusManagement]]
=== Job Status Management

Explain job status management method using ``JobRepository``. +
By {SB}, the following Entities are registered in the RDBMS table.

[cols="10,20,20,20,30", options="header"]
.Entity class and table name managed by JobRepository
|===
|Sr. No.
|Entity class
|Table name
|Generation unit
|Desctiption

|(1)
|``JobExecution``
|``BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION``
|Execution of one job
|Maintain job status/execution result.

|(2)
|``JobExecutionContext``
|``BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT``
|Execution of one job
|Maintain the context inside the job.

|(3)
|``JobExecutionParams``
|``BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_PARAMS``
|Execution of one job
|Hold job parameters given at startup.

|(4)
|``StepExecution``
|``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION``
|Execution of one step
|Maintain the state/execution result of the step, commit/rollback number.

|(5)
|``StepExecutionContext``
|``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT``
|Execution of one step
|Maintain the context inside the step.

|(6)
|``JobInstance``
|``BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE``
|Combination of job name and job parameter
|Hold job name and string serialized job parameter.

|===

For example, when three steps are executed with one job execution, the following difference occurs.

* ``JobExecution``, ``JobExecutionContext`` and ``JobExecutionParams`` register 1 record.
* ``StepExecution`` and ``StepExecutionContext`` register 3 record.

Also, ``JobInstance`` is used to suppress double execution by the same name job and same parameter started in the past,
{batch5_shortname} does not check this. For details, refer to  <<Ch07_JobManagement_DuplicateSafe,Double Activation Prevention>>.

[TIP]
====
The structure of each table by ``JobRepository`` is described
in <<Ch02_SpringBatchArchitecture.adoc#, Architecture of {SB}>>.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.About the item count of StepExecution in the chunk method
====
As shown below, it seems that inconsistency is occurring, but there are cases where it is reasonable from the specification.

* The transaction issue count of ``StepExecution(BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION table)`` sometimes does not match the number of input data counts.
** The number of transaction issues refers to the sum of ``COMMIT_COUNT`` and ``ROLLBACK_COUNT`` of ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION``. +
   However, ``COMMIT_COUNT`` becomes +1 if the number of input data is divisible by the chunk size. +
   This is because null representing the end is also counted as input data and is processed empty, after reading the number of input data counts.

* The number of processing of ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION`` and ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT`` may be different.
** In ``READ_COUNT`` and ``WRITE_COUNT`` of ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION``, the number of items read and written by ``ItemReader`` and ``ItemWriter`` are recorded.
** The ``SHORT_CONTEXT`` column in the ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT`` table records the number of read operations by ``ItemReader`` in JSON format.
However, it does not necessarily match the number of processing by ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION``. +
** This means that the ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION`` table based on the chunk method records the number of reads and writes irrespective of success or failure,
whereas the ``BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT`` table records the position to be resumed by a restart in case of a failure in the course of processing.
====

[[Ch07_JobManagement_JobStatusManagement_Persistence]]
==== Status Persistence
By using external RDBMS, job execution management information by ``JobRepository`` can be made persistent.
To enable this, change the following items in batch-application.properties to be data sources, schema settings for external RDBMS.

[source,properties]
.batch-application.properties

[IMPORTANT]
.Supplementary to administrative/business data sources
====
* Connection settings to DB are separately defined as management and business data sources. +
{batch5_shortname} separately defined,
``JobRepository`` has been set up to use an administrative data source prefixed with ``admin`` as its property prefix.

* When using asynchronous execution (DB polling), specify the same management data source and schema generation script in the job request table. +
For details, refer to <<Ch04_AsyncJobWithDB,Asynchronous Execution (DB polling)>>.

[[Ch07_JobManagement_JobStatusManagement_Retrieve]]
==== Confirmation of job status/execution result
Explain how to check the job execution status from ``JobRepository`` +
In either method, the job execution ID to be checked is known in advance.

===== Query directly
Using the RDBMS console, query directly on the table persisted by ``JobRepository``.

[source,sql]
.SQL sample

[[Ch07_JobManagement_JobStatusManagement_JobStop]]
==== Stopping a Job

"Stopping a job" is a function that updates the running status of ``JobRepository`` to a stopping status
and stops jobs at the boundary of steps or at chunk commit by chunk method. +
Combined with restart, processing from the stopped position can be restarted.

[TIP]
====
For details of the restart, refer to <<Ch06_ReProcessing.adoc#Ch06_RerunRestart_HowToUse_Restart,"Job Restart">>.
====

[CAUTION]
====
"Stopping a job" is not a function to immediately stop a job in progress but to update the running status of ``JobRepository`` to the stopping status. +
It does not perform any kind of stop processing such as interrupting the in-process thread immediately for the job.

Therefore, it can be said that stopping the job is "to reserve to stop when a processing that becomes a milestone is completed, such as a chunk break".
For example, even if you stop the job under the following circumstances, it will not be the expected behavior.

* Job execution consisting of ``Tasklet`` in a single step.
* When number of data input < ``commit-interval`` in chunk method.
* When an infinite loop has occurred within processing.
====

Explain how to stop the job below.

* Stop from command line
** Available for both synchronous and asynchronous jobs
** Use ``-stop`` option of ``CommandLineJobRunner``

[source,terminal]
.The method of specifying the job name at startup
----
$ java org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.CommandLineJobRunner \
    classpath:/META-INF/jobs/job01/job01.xml job01 -stop
----

* Stopping a job by its name specification is suitable for synchronous batch execution when jobs with the same name rarely start in parallel.

[source,terminal]
.The method of specifying the job execution ID (JobExecutionId)
----
$ java org.springframework.batch.core.launch.support.CommandLineJobRunner \
    classpath:/META-INF/jobs/job01/job01.xml 3 -stop
----

* Stopping a job by JobExecutionId specification is suitable for asynchronous batch execution when jobs with tha same name often start in parallel.

[TIP]
====
* For the confirmation method of JobExecutionId, refer to <<Ch07_JobManagement_JobStatusManagement_Retrieve>>.
* ``JobOpertion#stop()`` can be used to stop the job based on the JobExecutionId. +
For stopping jobs using ``JobOperation#stop()``,
refer to <<Ch04_AsyncJobWithWeb.adoc#Ch04_AsyncJobWithWeb_HowToExtend_Stop_And_Restart,"Stop and Restart Async Job">>.
====

[[Ch07_JobManagement_ExitCode]]
=== Customizing Exit Codes
When the job is terminated by synchronous execution, the exit code of the java process can be customized according to the end status of the job.
To customize the exit code, the following two operations are required.

1. Change the exit code of the job, which indicates the end status of the job.
2. Map the exit code (character string) of the job/step and the process exit code (numerical value).

Explain the following in order.

==== Change the exit code of the job.

The exit code of the job returned as a string can be changed.

* Implement the ``afterStep`` method to return a specific exit status at the end of the step.
** Implement ``StepExecutionListener``

[source,java]
.An implementation example of StepExecutionListener
----
@Component
public class ExitStatusChangeListener implements StepExecutionListener {

    @Override
    public ExitStatus afterStep(StepExecution stepExecution) {

        ExitStatus exitStatus = stepExecution.getExitStatus();
        if (conditionalCheck(stepExecution)) {
            // (1)
            exitStatus = new ExitStatus("CUSTOM STEP FAILED");
        }

            <entry key="CUSTOM FAILED" value="100" /> <!-- Custom Exit Status -->
        </util:map>
    </property>
</bean>
----

[WARNING]
.Process exit code 1 is prohibited
====
Generally, when a Java process is forcibly terminated due to a VM crash or SIGKILL signal reception,
the process may return 1 as the exit status.
Since it should be clearly distinguished from the end state of a batch application regardless of whether it is normal or abnormal,
do not define 1 as a process exit code within an application.
====

[TIP]
.About the difference between status and exit code
====
There are "status (``STATUS``)" and "exit code (``EXIT_CODE``)" as the states of jobs and steps managed by ``JobRepository``, but they differ in the following points.

* The status can not be customized because it is used in internal control of {SB} and specific value by enum type ``BatchStatus`` is defined.
* The exit code can be used for job flow control and process exit code change, and can be customized.
====

[[Ch07_JobManagement_DuplicateSafe]]
=== Double Activation Prevention

In {SB}, when running a job,
confirm whether the following combination exists from ``JobRepositry`` to ``JobInstance(BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE table)``.

* Job name to be activated
* Job parameters

{batch5_shortname} makes it possible to activate multiple times even if the combinations of job and job parameters match. +
That is, it allows double activation.
For details, refer to <<Ch04_JobParameter.adoc#,Job Activation Parameter>>

In order to prevent double activation, it is necessary to execute in the job scheduler or application. +
Detailed means are strongly dependent on job scheduler products and business requirements, so omitted here. +
Consider whether it is necessary to suppress double start for each job.

[[Ch07_JobManagement_Logging]]
=== Logging
Explain log setting method.

Log output, settings and considerations are in common with {server5_shortname}.
At first, refer to {server5_url}/ArchitectureInDetail/GeneralFuncDetail/Logging.html[Logging].

Explain specific considerations of {batch5_shortname} here.

==== Clarification of log output source

It is necessary to be able to clearly specify the output source job and job execution at the time of batch execution.
Therefore, it is good to output the thread name, the job name and the job execution ID.
Especially at asynchronous execution, since jobs with the same name will operate in parallel with different threads,
recording only the job name may make it difficult to specify the log output source.

Each element can be realized in the following way.

Thread name::
  Specify ``%thread`` which is the output pattern of ``logback.xml``
Job name / Job Execution ID::
  Create a component implementing ``JobExecutionListener`` and record it at the start and end of the job

[source,java]

==== Log Monitoring
In the batch application, the log is the main user interface of the operation.
Unless the monitoring target and the actions at the time of occurrence are clearly designed,
filtering becomes difficult and there is a danger that logs necessary for action are buried.
For this reason, it is advisable to determine in advance a message or code system to be a keyword to be monitored for logs.
For message management to be output to the log, refer to <<Ch07_JobManagement_MessageManagement,"Message Management">> below.

==== Log Output Destination
For log output destinations in batch applications, it is good to design in which units logs are distributed / aggregated.
For example, even when logs are output to a flat file, multiple patterns are considered as follows.

* Output to 1 file per 1 job
* Output to 1 file in units of multiple jobs grouped together
* 1 Output to 1 file per server
* Output multiple servers in 1 file

In each case, depending on the total number of jobs / the total amount of logs / I/O rate to be generated in the target system,
it is decided which unit is best to be grouped.
It also depends on how to check logs. It is assumed that options will change depending on the utilization method
such as whether to refer frequently from the job scheduler or from the console frequently.

The important thing is to carefully examine the log output in operational design and to verify the usefulness of the log in the test.

[[Ch07_JobManagement_MessageManagement]]
=== Message Management
Explain message management.

In order to prevent variations in the code system and to facilitate designing extraction as a keyword to be monitored,
it is desirable to give messages according to certain rules.

As with logging, message management is basically the same as {server5_shortname}.

[IMPORTANT]
.About utilization of MessageSource
====
``MessageSource`` can be used to use messages from property files.

* For specific settings and implementation examples,
  refer to {server5_url}/ja/ArchitectureInDetail/GeneralFuncDetail/Logging.html#id8[Uniform management of log messages]

** As a sample of log output here, it is exemplified along the case of the Spring MVC controller,
   but please replace it to any component of {SB}.
** Instance of ``MessageSource`` is generated independently here, but it is not necessary for {batch5_shortname}.
   This is because each component is accessed only after ``ApplicationContext`` is created.
   In {batch5_shortname}, it is set as follows.

[source,xml]
.launch-context.xml
----
<bean id="messageSource"
      class="org.springframework.context.support.ResourceBundleMessageSource"
      p:basenames="classpath:META-INF/i18n/application-messages" />

[[Ch07_JobManagement_Appendix]]
== Appendix. Spring Batch Admin

Spring Batch Admin is a subproject of {SB}, and it is possible to check the job execution status through the Web interface.
Introduce it because it can refer easily regardless of test/commercial environment.

Spring Batch Admin is distributed as a sample application.
Use Apache Tomcat as the web container and deploy the war file here.

[CAUTION]
====
Spring Batch Admin can not only check the execution status and results of jobs but also start and stop jobs.
In that case, It is needed to include the job in the same war file, which creates a strong restriction that it is essential to execute the job with the web container.
Since there is no necessity as long as it is just confirming the execution state/result, it is introduced as a reference method here.
====

The installation procedure is as follows.

* Download 1.3.1.RELEASE zip file from https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch-admin/releases[Release Distribution Site],
  and unzip it anywhere.
* Create an external RDBMS-defined property file ``batch-RDBMSNAME.properties``.
** Place it in ``spring-batch-admin-1.3.1.RELEASE/spring-batch-admin-sample/src/main/resources``.
